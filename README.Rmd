This is the code used for data processing and statistical analyses in Flaherty, R., et al. (2023). *Diffusion Imaging Markers of Accelerated Neuronal Aging of the Lower Cingulum in Subjective Cognitive Decline* [Manuscript submitted for publication]. Department of Radiology, New York University School of Medicine. 

## Directions
Running this code requires the following dependencies:

* RStudio >= 2023.09.1+494 with the following packages:
  + base >= 4.3.2 
  + tidyverse >= 2.0.0 
  + arsenal >= 3.6.3 
  + ggpmisc >= 0.5.4-1 
  + interactions >= 1.1.5 
  + ggtext >= 0.1.2 
* FreeSurfer == 7.4.1
* FSL == 6.0.4 
* MRTrix3 == 3.0 
* python == 3.7 with package dmri-amico == 1.5.4 (more detailed installation instructions for AMICO are available on [their github](https://github.com/daducci/AMICO/wiki/How-to-install-AMICO)) 
* zsh 
* MatLab >= 2023a with Image Processing Toolbox 

Scripts with .sbatch extensions are written for submission to a SLURM batch processing system on a HPC. It is highly recommended to conduct this analysis on an HPC. Scripts with .sh extensions are written for Mate Desktop. 

Run each numbered script in order. Unnumbered scripts are called by the numbered scripts and do not need to be called manually. Wait until the script finishes before starting the next numbered script.

The original analysis was conducted on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.4.
